> An educational simulation game for learning algorithmic optimization through route planning and fleet management.

**Course:** Art of Programming - Advanced Algorithms
**Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Core Models (Console Version)
**Python Version:** 3.10+

## Overview

The Delivery Fleet Management System is an interactive simulation where you manage a delivery company's fleet and optimize package delivery routes. The game teaches fundamental algorithmic concepts including greedy algorithms, backtracking, dynamic programming, and other optimization techniques.

### Key Learning Objectives

- **Algorithm Design:** Implement and compare different routing algorithms
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Work with clean class hierarchies and design patterns
- **Optimization:** Balance multiple objectives (cost, distance, capacity)
- **Problem Solving:** Apply algorithmic thinking to real-world scenarios
- **Software Architecture:** Understand separation of concerns and modular design

---

## Features

### Current (Phase 1)
✅ Core data models (Vehicle, Package, Route, Map, GameState)
✅ JSON-based data persistence
✅ Interactive console-based gameplay
✅ Day-by-day simulation cycle
✅ Financial management (balance, costs, revenues)
✅ Fleet management (purchase vehicles)
✅ Two routing algorithms:
  - **Greedy Agent:** Fast nearest-neighbor heuristic

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- No external dependencies for Phase 1!

### Setup
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd delivery_fleet_game

# No pip install needed for Phase 1!
# All dependencies are from Python standard library

# Run the game
python main.py
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start a New Game
```
$ python main.py

Choose option: 1 (Start New Game)
```

You'll start with:
- Balance: $100,000
- Fleet: 2 vehicles (1 small van, 1 medium truck)
- Day: 1

### 2. Begin a Day
```
Choose option: 4 (Start Day)
```

This loads packages for the current day from `data/packages_day1.json`.

### 3. Test Routing Agents
```
Choose option: 5 (Test Agent)
```

Compare different algorithms:
- **Greedy Agent:** O(n²), fast, decent solutions
- **Backtracking Agent:** O(m^n), slower, optimal solutions

The system will show metrics for each agent:
- Total distance
- Total cost
- Total revenue
- Profit
- Number of vehicles used

### 4. Apply Best Solution
```
Choose option: 6 (Apply Agent Solution)
```

Select the agent whose solution you want to use.

### 5. Execute the Day
```
Choose option: 7 (Execute Day)
```

This runs the delivery day with your planned routes and updates your balance.

### 6. Advance to Next Day
```
Choose option: 8 (Advance to Next Day)
```

### 7. Expand Your Fleet (Optional)
```
Choose option: 9 (Purchase Vehicle)
```

Buy new vehicles if your balance allows.

## Game Mechanics

### Day Cycle

Each game day has three phases:

1. **Planning Phase:**
   - Load packages for the day
   - Test different routing algorithms
   - Compare solutions
   - Choose best approach

2. **Execution Phase:**
   - Apply chosen solution
   - Execute routes
   - Calculate costs and revenues
   - Update balance

3. **Management Phase:**
   - Review performance
   - Purchase new vehicles (optional)
   - Advance to next day

### Financial System

**Income:**
- Package delivery payments (varies by package)

**Expenses:**
- Vehicle operating costs (distance × cost_per_km)
- Vehicle purchase costs

**Goal:** Maximize long-term profit!

### Constraints

**Hard Constraints (Must satisfy):**
- Package volume ≤ Vehicle capacity
- Route distance ≤ Vehicle max range
- All packages assigned to exactly one vehicle
- Routes start and end at depot (0, 0)

**Soft Constraints (Optimization goals):**
- Minimize total distance
- Maximize profit (revenue - costs)
- Minimize number of vehicles used
- Maximize capacity utilization

### Win/Lose Conditions

**Win:**
- Reach day 30 with balance > $200,000
- Maintain positive daily profit for 10 consecutive days

**Lose:**
- Balance drops below $0 (bankruptcy)
- Three consecutive days of losses

## Routing Algorithms

### Greedy Agent

**Strategy:** Make locally optimal choices at each step

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort packages by value density (payment/volume)
2. Assign packages using First-Fit Decreasing bin packing
3. Optimize route order with Nearest Neighbor TSP
4. Optionally apply 2-opt local search

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n²) where n = number of packages
- Space: O(n)

**Pros:**
- Very fast execution
- Simple to understand
- Good solutions for most cases

**Cons:**
- May not find optimal solution
- No backtracking
- Greedy choices can be suboptimal

### Backtracking Agent

**Strategy:** Exhaustive search with pruning

**Algorithm:**
1. Try assigning each package to each vehicle
2. Recursively assign remaining packages
3. Prune branches that violate capacity
4. Track best solution found (by profit)
5. Backtrack and try alternatives

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(m^n) where m = vehicles, n = packages
- Space: O(n) for recursion stack

**Pros:**
- Can find optimal solutions
- Systematic exploration
- Educational value

**Cons:**
- Exponential time complexity
- Only practical for ~15-20 packages
- Slow compared to greedy

### Pruning Backtracking Agent

Enhanced backtracking with:
- **Bounding:** Prune branches that can't beat best known solution
- **Symmetry breaking:** Avoid exploring equivalent solutions

Explores fewer nodes than basic backtracking.

## Extending the System

### Adding a New Routing Agent

1. Create a new file in `src/agents/`:

```python
from .base_agent import RouteAgent
from ..models import Package, Vehicle, Route

class MyAgent(RouteAgent):
    def __init__(self, delivery_map):
        super().__init__(delivery_map, "My Agent")
        self.description = "My custom algorithm"

    def plan_routes(self, packages, fleet):
        # Your algorithm here
        routes = []
        # ... create routes ...
        return routes
```

2. Register in `main.py`:

```python
engine.register_agent("my_agent", MyAgent(engine.delivery_map))
```

3. Test and compare!

### Creating Custom Package Data

Create `data/packages_dayX.json`:

```json
{
  "day": X,
  "packages": [
    {
      "id": "pkg_xxx",
      "destination": {"x": 20, "y": 30},
      "volume_m3": 2.5,
      "payment": 50,
      "priority": 1,
      "description": "Electronics"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Educational Notes

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Strategy Pattern:** RouteAgent hierarchy allows swapping algorithms
2. **Data Class Pattern:** Clean, immutable data models
3. **Dependency Injection:** Map passed to agents for testability
4. **Repository Pattern:** DataLoader abstracts storage

### Algorithmic Concepts

- **Greedy Algorithms:** Local optimization, heuristics
- **Backtracking:** Exhaustive search, pruning, branch-and-bound
- **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem):** NP-hard optimization
- **Bin Packing:** Capacity-constrained assignment
- **Constraint Satisfaction:** Validation and feasibility

### Code Quality

- Full type hints for IDE support
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable, modular architecture
- PEP 8 compliant

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No packages found for day X"
Create `data/packages_dayX.json` following the template in existing day files.

### "Agent produced no routes"
Check that:
- Packages were loaded (option 4)
- Fleet has available vehicles
- Total package volume doesn't exceed fleet capacity

### Backtracking agent is very slow
This is expected! Backtracking is exponential. Either:
- Reduce `max_packages` parameter
- Use fewer packages in test data
- Use greedy agent for larger problems

"""
Student routing agent - Sweep Algorithm implementation.

The Sweep Algorithm uses polar angle sorting to create geographically
efficient routes. It sweeps around the depot like a radar, grouping
nearby packages together.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n²) for TSP = O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Trade-offs:
+ Good for radially distributed packages
+ Simple to understand and implement
+ Fast execution
+ Creates geographically coherent routes
- Not optimal for clustered distributions
- Doesn't prioritize package value
- Sensitive to depot location

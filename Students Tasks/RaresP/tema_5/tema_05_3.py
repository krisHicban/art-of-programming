# [x] III. Optional Topic (Advanced Level) – Blackjack
# Goal: build the Blackjack game engine using functions.

# The main program must call only 2 functions:
#   player = seat_player(name, budget)
#   run_blackjack(player)

# The rest should be organized through functions.
# The program must run step by step, stopping whenever user input is required
# (e.g., when deciding whether to “Hit” or “Hold”).

"""
## Flow

First: prompt AI as such:
    Explain blackjack rules in an organized manner
Second: Organize rules manually and make functions as you go

## Blackjack Rules:

Traditional: 1 deck 
Modern: 4-8 decks

Players: 1-7 players against dealer

[x] Objectives:
    [x] Get a hand closer to 21 than house
    [x] Do not go over 21

[x] Card Values:
    [x] Number Cards: 2-10 - face value
    [x] Face Cards: (J, Q, K): 10 points
    [x] Ace (A): 1 or 11 (whichever benefits the player's hand)

[x] Initial Deal:
    [x] Each player gets 2 cards face up
    [x] Dealer gets:
        - 1 card face up (the "upcard")
        - 1 card face down (the "hole card")
    [x] Order:
        - each player gets 1 face up card
        - dealer gets 1 card face up (the "upcard")
        - each player gets 1 face up card
        - dealer gets 1 card face down (the "hole card")

[x] Betting (before any cards are dealt)

[x] Player's Turn:
    Each Player decides:
    [x] - Hit: take another card
    [x] - Stand (Hold): keep current hand
    [x] - Double Down (optional rule): 
        double the bet, take one card only, then stand
    [ ] - Split (optional rule):
        if both cards are the same value, 
        split into two hands (requires another bet)
    Player continues until they 'Stand' or 'Bust'

[x] Dealer's Turn:
    - Dealer reveals his hole card
    - Must hit until reaching 17 or higher (rules vary)

[x] Resolution - Compare Hands:
    - Player Hand > Dealer Hand -> Player wins
    - Dealer Hand > Player Hand -> Dealer wins
    - Tie -> Push (no one wins, bet returned)
